Tic Tac Toe 

This project is 1st project in the 3rd term of Udacity VR nanodegree.

What is the goal of the project ? 

Optimize the game 

What did I do ? 

1. I have replaced all of the game models that have a big number of tris and vertices with ones that have smaller numbers 

2. Set all of the none moving objects to static 

3. Used baked lighting, changed all of the games lights to be baked

4. Changed shaders to be mobile/ unlit (support lightmaps)

5. Changed quality settings to disable the anti-aliasing 

6. got rid of shadows by disabling them 


Challenges:

finding the right thing to do by using the frame debugger and the profiler, and optimize the game accordingly, while keeping the game looking good.
